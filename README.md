# Memory Card Game for Android in Java

Creating a basic memory game involving cards for an Android app in Java can be a fun and rewarding project. This document outlines a simple way to implement such a game. This game will have a grid of cards, each with a matching pair. Players will flip two cards at a time, trying to find pairs of matching cards until all pairs are found.

## Game Concept

- **Grid Size**: The game will feature a grid of cards, typically 4x4, for a total of 16 cards, making 8 pairs to match. You can adjust the grid size based on difficulty levels.
- **Game Objective**: The player needs to match all pairs of cards with the fewest flips possible.

## Basic Components

1. **Card Model**: This is a simple object representing each card.
   - Properties: `id`, `imageResource`, `isFlipped`, `isMatched`
   - Methods: Constructor, getters, and setters

2. **Game Logic**: Manages the state and logic of the game.
   - Initializing the game: Shuffling cards and laying them out in the grid.
   - Handling flips: What happens when a card is flipped?
   - Checking for matches: Determine if two flipped cards match.
   - Game end condition: The game ends when all cards are matched.

3. **User Interface**: Displaying the cards and game state to the player.
   - Card grid: Display the cards in a grid layout.
   - Flip animations: Animate the flipping of cards.
   - Game state: Show the current number of flips and matches.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create the Card Model**
   - Define a `Card` class with the properties mentioned above.

2. **Design the Game Layout**
   - Use `GridLayout` in your activity's XML layout file to arrange the cards.

3. **Implement the Game Logic**
   - In your main activity, initialize the game by creating instances of the `Card` class and assigning them images in pairs. Then, shuffle these cards.
   - Handle user input to flip cards and determine if two flipped cards are a match. If they match, keep them flipped and marked as matched. If not, flip them back after a short delay.
   - Keep track of the state of each card (flipped, matched) and the number of flips.

4. **UI and Interaction**
   - For each card in the grid, use a `Button` or an `ImageView`. Set an initial image that represents the back of a card. When a card is flipped, change the image to its front image.
   - Implement onClick listeners for the cards to handle flipping.
   - Use animations to enhance the flipping effect.

5. **Final Touches**
   - Add a counter to track the number of moves.
   - Implement a reset function to start a new game.
   - Optionally, add difficulty levels by increasing the grid size.

## Code Snippet Example

Here's a simple example to get you started with the card model:

```java
public class Card {
    private int id;
    private boolean isFlipped = false;
    private boolean isMatched = false;

    public Card(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    // Getters and setters
}
```
